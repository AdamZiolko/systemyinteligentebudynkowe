Yes, the .htaccess file and Apache configuration are crucial for a PHP application to work correctly on a server.

The .htaccess file, if used, should be located in the root directory of your application. It can contain various directives to control the behavior of your application, such as URL rewriting rules, access control, and performance optimizations.

Here's a basic example of a .htaccess file that ensures PHP files are processed correctly:

This file enables the mod_rewrite module (if it's not already enabled), turns on the rewrite engine, and then sets up a rule that redirects all requests to index.php unless the requested file or directory actually exists. This is a common setup for PHP applications that use a front controller pattern.

In your Apache configuration, you should have a section that tells Apache to process .php files with PHP. This is usually done with the AddType directive. Here's an example:

This tells Apache to use the mod_php5 module to process files with a .php extension, and to use the same module to process .phps files as PHP source code.

If you're having trouble with your PHP application, checking these two areas is a good place to start.
